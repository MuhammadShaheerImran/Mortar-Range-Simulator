Mortar Range Simulator 

A physics-based C++ mortar trajectory simulator that calculates projectile motion with Earth curvature, wind influence, and elevation angles. The program applies real mathematical and physical models to simulate long-range mortar firing.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Calculates target distance using the Haversine formula.

Computes both low-arc and high-arc elevation angles.

Adjusts for wind speed and wind direction.

Considers Earth curvature for realistic long-range simulation.

Outputs accurate results in a clear and structured format.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Mortar-Range-Simulator.git


Navigate into the folder:

cd Mortar-Range-Simulator


Compile the program:

g++ mortar_simulator.cpp -o mortar_simulator


Run the executable:

./mortar_simulator

ðŸ”¹ Example Input
Mortar Latitude: 41.0082  
Mortar Longitude: 28.9784  
Target Latitude: 41.1050  
Target Longitude: 29.0101
