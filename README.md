# Mortar-Range-Simulator
A C++ mortar trajectory simulator that calculates projectile motion with Earth curvature, wind influence, and elevation angles. Uses the Haversine formula for distance, providing both low-arc and high-arc firing solutions. Demonstrates applied physics, math, and programming in real-world ballistics.
